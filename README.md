# Password-checker
A simple GUI-based Python application that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords and provides instant feedback along with improvement suggestions. This project helps users create stronger, more secure passwords and understand the basic principles of password security.

Features :
1.Checks password strength in real-time (Weak / Medium / Strong)
2. Uses Regex to analyze structure (length, digits, symbols, uppercase, etc.)
3. Optionally uses NLTK to detect dictionary-based passwords
4. Suggests stronger alternatives
5.Built with Tkinter for a clean, interactive GUI

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Python-Core programming language for logic
Tkinter-	GUI toolkit for building the interface
Regex (re)-	Used to validate and pattern-match password structure
NLTK -(optional)	Used to identify dictionary-based (guessable) words in the password
File Handling-	(Optional) Save password strength reports
