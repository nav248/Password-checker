1.Checks password strength in real-time (Weak / Medium / Strong)

2. Uses Regex to analyze structure (length, digits, symbols, uppercase, etc.)
   
3. Optionally uses NLTK to detect dictionary-based passwords
   
4. Suggests stronger alternatives

5.Built with Tkinter for a clean, interactive GUI

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

1.Python - Core programming language for logic

2.Tkinter -	GUI toolkit for building the interface

3.Regex (re) -	Used to validate and pattern-match password structure

4.NLTK - (optional)	Used to identify dictionary-based (guessable) words in the password

5.File Handling -	(Optional) Save password strength reports
